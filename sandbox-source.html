            <h1>Sandbox Verification Source</h1>
            <p>In order to facilitate integration testing with the SheerID REST API, we have developed the Sandbox Verification Source.  This allows developers to make API requests which behave just like production requests without incurring traffic against our verification databases.</p>
        
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>The Sandbox Verification Source is used when verification requests are issued to the hostname <code>services-sandbox.sheerid.com</code>. An example URL is shown below:</p>
        
            <code class="block">
            https://services-sandbox.sheerid.com/rest/0.5/verification
            </code>
        
            <h2>Request Details</h2>
            <p>The Sandbox Verification Source is able to simulate a number of different verification scenarios.  Most verifications require at a minimum the following 3 fields to be supplied in a request to the <a href="/docs/verification/verify.html">verify</a> method. For more information about these fields, refer to the <a href="/docs/fields.html">listFields</a> method documentation.</p>
        
            <ul style="list-style: square;">
                <li><code>FIRST_NAME</code></li>
                <li><code>LAST_NAME</code></li>
                <li><code>BIRTH_DATE</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some verifications require different or additional information such as postal code, identification number, or a discharge date.</p>

            <h1>Controlling the Verification Results</h1>

            <h2>Testing Instructions for AUTHORITATIVE</h2>

            <p>Additionally, the results of the response from the Sandbox Verification Source can be controlled by passing a specific value for certain fields such as <code>BIRTH_DATE</code>.  Refer to the tables below for lists of possible outcomes.</p>

            <p>Here is the hierarchical order of fields in which we attempt to verify first</p>
            <ol>
                <li><code>BIRTH_DATE</code></li>
                <li><code>SSN_LAST4</code></li>
                <li><code>ID_NUMBER</code></li>
                <li><code>POSTAL_CODE</code></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Most verifications can be controlled using the date of birth since it is the first field in the order above.</p>

            <p>When verifying a retired military service member, you can use the discharge date.  We define a military retiree as an individual who has served a minimum of 20 years and has been discharged.  To simulate this in the sandbox we assume the user joined the service on their 18th birthday and served 20 years or more.</p>

            <P>When verifying <a href="/docs/fields.html">affiliation types that do not have an authoritative source</a> to check against the verification will return null.  To test manual verification scenarios a user can use the <a href="/docs/asset/upload.html">asset upload api method</a> to upload documents which can be reviewed in the asset review utility in the control center and approved or rejected.</p>

            <h2>Testing Server Delay/Latency</h2>
            <p>Occasionally, SheerID authoritative sources may be experiencing delays. To simulate a delay for the verification response, perform a verification using <code>FIRST_NAME = delay</code> and <code>LAST_NAME = $delayInMilliseconds</code>, up to 10000 (10 seconds).</p>
            <p>Example verification request with an 8 second delay:</p>
            <code class="block">$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d _affiliationTypes=FACULTY -d organizationType=UNIVERSITY -d FIRST_NAME=Delay -d LAST_NAME=8000 -d BIRTH_DATE=1999-12-01 -d EMAIL=test@example.com -d organizationId=191982 https://services-sandbox.sheerid.com/rest/0.5/verification</code>

            <h2>Testing Recoverable Errors and Unsupported Instant Verification Scenarios</h2>
            <p>SheerID authoritative sources may return multiple results for a verification request based on the fields submitted for verification. Additionally, authoritative sources may be unavailable or we may not have authoritative coverage for the specific affiliation attempting to be verified.</p>
            <p>To simulate these error scenarios for the verification response, perform a verification using <code>FIRST_NAME = error</code> and <code>LAST_NAME = $errorCode</code>.</p>
            <p>Error codes that can be tested in this fashion:</p>
            <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped sheerid-green">

            <h2>Testing Instructions for SSO</h2>
            <p>First, you will need to pick an Organization that has an SSO provider configured. You should be able to find this in Organization Management (tag: HEI-SSO). These organizations can also be listed via REST API (see the following example URL):</p>
            <code class="block">
                https://services-sandbox.sheerid.com/rest/0.5/organization?type=UNIVERSITY&tag=HEI-SSO&country=GB
            </code>
            <p>Use the following curl command as an example to test SSO verification using the sandbox.</p>
            <code class="block">
                $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d _affiliationTypes=FACULTY -d organizationType=UNIVERSITY -d FIRST_NAME=Sam -d LAST_NAME=Doe -d BIRTH_DATE=1999-12-01 -d EMAIL=$(uuidgen)@example.com -d organizationId=191982 https://services-sandbox.sheerid.com/rest/0.5/verification
            </code>
            <p>Next, we will use the following curl command to check to make sure the result = null for the verification by using the requestId from the previous curl response.</p>
            <code class="block">
                $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://services-sandbox.sheerid.com/rest/0.5/verification/${requestId}
            </code>
            <p>Next, in a browser navigate to the following url using the requestId that was returned in the response from the command above.</p>
            <code class="block">
                https://services-sandbox.sheerid.com/rest/0.5/verification/sso/${requestId}
            </code>
            <p>The page that opens up will have instructions on how to log in etc. If you run the previous curl command again you will notice that the status='PENDING' and the result=null. This page uses cookies to store the SSO session token so if you wish to do multiple verifications you will need to clear cookies between tests or use the incognito browser.</p>
            <p>If you log in with valid credentials (provided on the login page) that match the affiliation type(s) being verified (see table below), you will see the following message 'Verification Complete'. Now if you re-run the previous curl command you will notice that the status='COMPLETE' and the result='true'</p>

            <p>If you log in with valid credentials (provided on the login page) that do not match the affiliation type(s) being verified (see table below), you will see the following message 'Verification Complete'. Now if you re-run the previous curl command you will notice that the status='COMPLETE' and the result='false'</p>

            <p>In the Organization Management you will notice that each organization has an email domain whitelist. These domains can be used to validate that the user actually has an email address with the whitelist.</p>
            <p>An email is sent to the user with a link with a verification code that will need to be clicked. If the user clicks the link and the verification code is correct then they have been validated by the <code>EMAIL_LOOP</code> source.</p>

            <h2>Testing Instructions for IP ADDRESS</h2>
            <p><code>IP_ADDRESS</code> is similar validated in a similar fashion. In the Organization Management you will notice that there is an IP List. Every request has a metadata where the IP Address is stored.</p>
            <p>If the user's IP Address is in the org list then they will get validated by the <code>IP_ADDRESS</code> source.</p>
