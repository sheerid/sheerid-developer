# SheerID Status Mailing List

## Overview

SheerID maintains a SheerID-status notification email list used for advanced notification of scheduled service downtime and real-time incident notification of unscheduled performance degradation. Appropriate customer staff are strongly encouraged to subscribe to this notification service to stay informed about SheerID availability incidents and service changes.

## Subscription

Users can subscribe by sending an email to [`sheerid-status+subscribe@googlegroups.com`](mailto:sheerid-status+subscribe@googlegroups.com). Once subscribed, users have the option of receiving email updates or digest summaries. A history of past notification topics is available via the Google Groups web interface.

## Notifications

 * Advance notice for any scheduled maintenance requiring service downtime (24 hours as a minimum)
 * Acknowledgement of an unplanned availability event, including any ETA on service restoration (as quickly as reasonably possible)
 * Event details and root cause analysis (made available as applicable after resolution of significant issues)
 * Other important information applicable to consumers of SheerID REST API and applications.
